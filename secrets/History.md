The beginning...
===============

Originally, I wanted to use Factor to create megauni. However, 
I decided the libraries of Ruby were developing very fast. I then
decided to use JavaScript. 

Originally, the name changed from UniLang to i\_love\_u.  Now,
it is Factor\_Script. This version of the language is based on
parts of the Factor language, not the compiler or object system. 
The previous version (UniLang/i\_love\_u) was more influenced by 
HyperTalk and some inspiration by Factor. That version was meant to
allow the programmer to mold the language into English, Japanese, Spanish,
etc.

Factor\_Script is more strict: it forces you to be clear, not familiar (e.g.
English, Spanish, Japanese, etc). Yet, it does have some flexibility:
you can be postfix or prefix.

Variables are introduced as key/value settings in the current environment 
(aka scope). This is a bending towards the will of the user because the 
user/programmer is not willing to embrace the awesomeness of 
concatentive, stack based architecture.
