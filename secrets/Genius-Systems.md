How do you make genius systems popular with The Moron Majority?
===============================================================

* Genius systems have to be 100% compatible (import/export)
  with moron systems. Why? The world is controlled by The
  Moron Majority. For most intents and purposes, THEY ARE
  THE MARKET. Geniuses are too cheap and lazy to go against
  the Moron Majority. If they were not, Xanadu and Squeak
  would have no shortage of volunteers and donations.

* It needs to have a killer application with
  the Moron Majority: spreadsheets, email/tweets/etc.

* It needs to be popular with teens and college students.
  They are the next generation to replace adult morons
  and retiring morons. The rest of the industry goes where
  the teens and college students are: parents, grandparents,
  employers, B2C businesses, etc.

* It needs to allow short messages in a stream: Moron-version
  of collaboration: email, comments, message boards, etc.

* It needs to allow Morons to create surveys, surveys, and
  more surveys: quickly and easily.

* It needs to be an omni-morph: cost savings and savings in time
  to respond to trends and whims of The Moron Majority.

* Most important of all: your competition is not a competitor
  but email. Email is eternal because it is the tool The
  Moron Majority misuse for collaboration, surveys, etc.
  It is the best example of how The Moron Majority settles
  for little beyond friend-to-friend-to-family chatter.

* Accept The Moron Majority only cares about opening their
  mouths. They do not care about anything else: education,
  learning, standard of living, end of poverty. They will
  be satisfied ONLY when they are talking. Learning gets
  in the way of talking.
