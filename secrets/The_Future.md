In the future...
================

  * if/else, switch, etc. will have GUIs. (based on
      Alan Kay's idea of objects having a graphical
      representation for humans to interact with...
      NOT TO BE INTERPRETED AS OBJECTS FORMING A
      GUI. Instead, objects HAVE a gui.)
  * Therefore, programs will have a 3D, fractal,
    dendretical structure... like a nervous system,
    lightnintg bolt + spider web structure.
    Ted Nelson's ZigZag data structures are a subset
    of this.
  * Computers will be a block of clear material.
    Sending a signal (magnetic, electrical, light,
    etc.) will cause it to change color or state.
    It will keep this color or state. The CPU
    will finally be the same as memory and video
    screen.
  * Most important of it all: The Electric Uni.
    Theory, , and Fringe Theorys will allow non-Ph.Ds
    (outsider omni-curious personality amatuers)
    to develop this "impossible" future.

  * People will still just want to talk with their idiot
    friends and family. Faradays and Slava Pestovs will
    still be rare.  More reason why:
